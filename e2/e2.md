# Summary

This exercise helped put some additional thought into the target groups who are likely to visit exhibitions at the museum. This brings with it some additional thoughts. Someone like Pons who is effectively a stand-in for many of the younger tourists who visit Iceland for the various outdoor sights would likely not prioritize the museum and is likely to pick it as a fallback, which was the beginning setting of the storyboard on the previous page. If the intention were to target this group more it becomes important to ensure that the museum has sufficient exposure on social media and is also cost competitive with alternative low-effort indoor activities.

That type of exposure as well as the one-time ticket cost becomes less important when considering people more like John. In his case its more likely that a day in the museum would be part of the planned schedule of a tour group which cuts out the individual level investigation portion of the challenge. This group would likely place some extra strain on the actual mechanics of entry at the museum - ideally then it should be possible for a guide to wave through a pre-registered tour group quickly and easily. It is then important to consider that the mechanics of entering the exhibition area work for both large groups as well as individuals. 

The final perspective that is likely worth keeping in mind is locals like Alda. They are more likely to know the museum exists already but would be more interested to see information about new temporary exhibitions whereas for tourists it is likely that they will only ever visit the museum once and will therefore be fine visiting the permanent Icelandic history exhibition. Here it would be useful to continue and further examine the value propositions of the different tickets and how those tickets compete with activities that could potentially be competing with going to a museum exhibition. A year long access ticket might be of value to locals as long as new temporary exhibitions cycle in and out frequently enough but Pons would still be forced to buy this ticket for a single visit, and this might make the museum a less attractive option for him.
